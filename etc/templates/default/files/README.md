Not available yet.

## Features

- Built on [Deno](https://deno.land). So it supports Modern Web APIs.
- Transpiles [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
  [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/) out of the box.

## Quick start

Ensure that `Deno` is installed on your system first.

Clone this git repo `git clone https://github.com/eserozvataf/dext.git` -
and checkout the
[tagged release](https://github.com/eserozvataf/dext/releases) you'd like
to use.

**Important**: local env files (i.e., `.env.local`) is git-ignored, so you can
have secret your sensitive environment variables by creating local copies of
environment variables before running the service.
